> 2021 web project for our 'TCC': Vecep - Fuvest

## :book: About the project
Our purpose is to help our users lead towards USP's (The University of S√£o Paulo) acceptance, in the best, old-fashioned way: by practicing, practicing and practicing!

As an undergraduate thesis project, Vecep - Fuvest faces some difficulties on whether to prioritize/decide to implement a feature or not. For the moment, we've decided to only carry through essential items.

### Current progress and next steps

The project is still under the development stage and its future updates will be focused on:

- [x] Design concept
- [x] Project setup
- [x] Frontend main pages
- [x] Database structure
- [x] Backend core
- [x] Client/Server integration
- [x] Populate database
- [x] Carry out front
- [x] User/login feature
